# Notando
Notando is a small Python-based alternative to MS OneNote etc.
- Although it's not really _as good_ right now, I hope it's getting significantly better in the future!
- Notando currently runs v1.x.y and is still worked on, so if you find it too impractical at the moment, stay tuned for updates ðŸ™‚.
- You're free to copy, share and/or modify Notando, as it's open source, but you're strongly encouraged to name [Nina Tolfersheimer](https://github.com/NinaTolfersheimer) as the original author and to perform a pull request, even if your code doesn't come with big improvements.
- Notando is working under Windows and Linux (GNU/Debian), though it could work on macOS as well.
- _IMPORTANT:_ Notando comes with **no warranty whatsoever**, and you're running it **completely at your own risk!**

If case you've expected some kind of documentation or something on this site, don't worry! I'll add one soon... ðŸ˜‰


```Python
from NinaTolfersheimer import Notando
```
