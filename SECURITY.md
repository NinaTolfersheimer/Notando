# Notando Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest version is always the most up-to-date. It is highly recommended you always use the latest version of Notando, as any other versions probably won't be maintained any longer.
However, if a serious security vulnerability should occur at some point, I'll probably provide fixed versions for the most recent versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you should spot a vulnerability, you should immideatly open an issue or [e-mail](mailto:nina.tolfersheimer@gmail.com) the author Nina Tolfersheimer.
