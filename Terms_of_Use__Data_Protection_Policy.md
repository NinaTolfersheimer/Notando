# Terms of Use & Data Protection Policy – Notando v1.1.0

I've created this little tool in my spare free time and with no commercial intentions whatsoever. Notando is open-source, so feel free to edit and spread Notando yourself!

But please be fair: Refrain from selling it, and refer to [my GitHub page](https://github.com/NinaTolfersheimer) as the original source, where sometimes updates and new versions will be published.

Feel free to open an issue when you find a bug or something is not working and to propose changes via pull requests. But please keep in mind that programming is just another hobby of mine, and that it may take me some time to react. It also may very well be that there are a whole lot of bugs or inaccuracies in the code – as I said, programming is just another hobby of mine. That's why the code is pretty basic, as well.

If you wish to contact me, I'd prefer you use the issues function. However, if this doesn't work or you do not want others to be able to read your issue, feel free to [mail](mailto:nina.tolfersheimer@posteo.de) to me in English or German :smile:

Notando collects your local username, but **no other personal data**, unless you provide it directly to the script. Please make sure to store your notes in a place only you have access to, because they are not protected by themselves. But that's your responsibility :wink:
